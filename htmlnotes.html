#Attributes in HTML:
HTML attributes are used to define the characteristics of an HTML element. They are placed within the 
element's opening tag and consist of two parts: the name and the value.
1.Name: Specifies the property for that element.
2.Value: Sets the value of that property for the element

*1. ID attribute: 
>>>The ID attribute is used to assign a unique identifier to an HTML element. Each element with an ID 
has its own unique identity, 
*2. Class attribute:
>>>The class attribute is used to associate an HTML element with a particular class, typically for 
styling or JavaScript manipulation. Unlike the ID attribute, the class attribute is not unique, and 
multiple elements can share the same class.
*3. Title attribute:
>>>The title attribute provides additional information about an element and is often displayed as a 
tooltip when the mouse hovers over it.
*4. Style attribute:
>>>The style attribute allows for inline styling of HTML elements. It is used in conjunction with CSS 
properties to directly style individual elements within the HTML code.

#Types of Tags in html:

*1. Skeletal Tags: 
<head>,<html>,<title>,<body>
*2. Heading Tags: 
<h1>,<h2>,...,<h6>
*3. Paragraph Tag <p>:
    It's advisable to use the <p> tag for textual content and not for layout control. 
For layout purposes, consider using HTML5 semantic tags like <section>, <article>, or CSS techniques
*4. Horizontal line Tag <hr>: 
The <hr> tag is an empty or self-closing tag, meaning it doesn't require a 
closing tag. 
It serves as a visual separator, dividing different sections of your document with a horizontal line.
*5. Line Break Tag: 
This tag is responsible for breaking text lines or separating paragraphs. When implemented, 
it automatically moves the text following the tag to the next line.
*6. Anchor Tag: 
-Also known as hyperlinks.
-Used to link one document to another.
HTML links primarily use two attributes:
-href attribute: Defines the URL the link points to.
-target attribute: Specifies where to open the linked document.

#Tables in HTML:

*Key Elements of HTML Table
1.<table>: Defines the table itself.
2.<tr>: Used for table rows.
3.<th>: Used for table headings.
4.<td>: Used for table cells (data).

*Rowspan: 
If you want a table cell to span multiple rows, you can use the rowspan attribute.
*Colspan: 
If you want a table cell to span multiple columns, you can use the colspan attribute.

e.g:
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">Merged Columns</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Column 1</td>
    <td>Column 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

*Column Groups:
You can use the <colgroup> and <col> elements to apply styles to an entire column in an HTML table.

Implementing Tables in HTML
<table>
  <caption><strong><u>Currently Showing</u></strong></caption>
  <colgroup>
      <col span="1" style="background-color:rgb(222, 21, 233)">
      <col span="1" style="background-color:rgba(65, 143, 163, 0.893)">
      <col span="1" style="background-color:rgba(161, 98, 137, 0.893)">
  </colgroup>
  <thead style="background-color: rgb(209, 255, 23);">

          <th><u>Show name</u></th>
          <th><u>Rating(10)</u></th>
          <th><u>Show ID</u></th>
      </tr>

#Lists in HTML:

*Types of Lists:
1. Unrdered List: Displays items in bullets.
2. Ordered List: Displays in ordered sequence and supports numerals,roman numerals, alphabetical,etc.
3. Definition List: Organizes items in a format similar to a dictionary

#Forms in HTML:
How to Use Form Controls?
>>>The <input> tag is commonly used to create form controls. The attributes of this tag define the 
control's behavior.
Syntax: <input type="" name="" value="">
1.The "type" attribute specifies the type of input control (e.g., text, password, checkbox).
2.The "name" attribute is used for identifying the control, especially when the data is sent to the 
server.
3.The "value" attribute sets a default value for the control, which the user can overwrite.

*Radio type input:
>>>When using radio type input to select one item or group of items at once we can set their name same.
For eg. <input name="male" type="radio"> and <input name="female" type="radio"> both can be selected
but <input name="gender" type="radio"> and <input name="gender" type="radio"> both cannot be selected.

*Label element <label>:
>>>The label tag defines a label for many form elements. The for attribute of the label tag should be
equal to the id attribute of the <input> element to bind them together.
>>>It is useful for screen reader users as the reader reads out the content of the <label> element when
the user focuses on the <input> element.
>>>The <label> element also helps user who have difficulty clicking on very small regions such as radio
buttons or checkboxes - because when the user clicks the region around the input element they auto
matically get selected.

Imp input types:
1.submit:	Represents a button that, when pressed, submits the form.
2.reset:	Represents a button that, when pressed, resets all the form controls to their initial values
3.color:	Allows the user to select a color.
4.date:	Allows the user to select a date.
5.email
6.password
7.file
8.image: allows user to add an image that acts as a button.
Once the submit button is pressed all the form values are stored in their respective
name attribute fields and stored in url as shown:
http://127.0.0.1:3000/form.html?name=Chetan+Joshi&email=chetanjoshi1511%40gmail.com&DOB=2003-10-11&mobile=8368575920

*New HTML5 Attributes
1.placeholder
>>>This attribute provides a hint to the user as to what can be entered in the field.
<input type="text" placeholder="Enter your username">

2.required
>>>The required attribute makes a field mandatory to fill out.
<input type="text" required>

3.autofocus
The autofocus attribute automatically focuses the cursor on the particular input when the page loads.
<input type="text" autofocus>

-HTML5 Validation Attributes
5.required
As mentioned above, this attribute makes a field mandatory.

machine will read it.
